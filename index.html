            <h2 id="about-english">About English</h2>

            <p>I learn English on my own, taking information from all the resources, such as videos, games, applications
                and communication on social networks.</p>

            <h2 id="other-information">Other information</h2>

            <p>I graduated from the BNTU Faculty of Information Technology and Robotics. I worked for 3 months on
                assignment and was taken into the army. Now I am learning javascript just because I like it. And I want
                to get into automated testing. Since I think this is an important stage in the software life cycle for
                the user and it is more interesting to me. My main qualities are energy and quick learning. And the main
                drawback is probably excessive emotionality. I love reading books and boxing, but lately all my free
                time is programming. My biggest and most rewarding achievement I think is serving in the army.</p>
